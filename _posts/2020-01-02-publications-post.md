Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

* <strong>A Few Days North of Vienna</strong>, <em>2003</em>: Writers of the Future, Volume 19<br />
	The story that started it all, more or less. This was perhaps the most mind-blowing experience of my life and I still
	have to convince myself that it happened. A great thrill to have my name alongside luminaries like Ken Liu, Jay Lake, Myke Cole, and
	who can forget my unforgettable WOTF roomie, Steve Saville [Entry on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hubbard-Presents-Writers-Future-Vol/dp/1592121659)
	<br />
* <strong>Secrets from the Land Without Fear</strong>, <em>2019</em>: Infinite Lives: Short Tales of Longevity<br />
	My first story to be published after essentially giving it all up to concenrate on programming in late 2005. Part of Juliana Rew and Third Flatiron publishing's
	great anthology series. [Get it here on Amazon!](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Lives-Longevity-Flatiron-Anthologies-ebook/dp/B07XVN23X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)
	<br />
* <strong>AstroNosferatu and the Invisible Void</strong>, <em>2019</em>: Monsters in Spaaaace!<br />
	This one is just pure fun. Mike Cieslak and the fine folks at Dragon's Roost Press put out an anothology call for, well, old-style movie monsters in space.
	I just had to throw my hat into the ring. [Get it here on Amazon!](https://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Spaaaace-Michael-Cieslak/dp/0998887897/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=monsters+in+spaaaace&qid=1580514870&s=digital-text&sr=1-1-catcorr)
	<br />
* <strong>All Aboard!</strong>, <em>2020</em>: Laughing at Shadows<br />
	Brett Reistroffer and Bad Dream Entertainment bring you the finest in comedy-based horror (or is that the other way around?) since the Evil Dead.
	Very proud to be a part of this one -- it was the story that told me I might actually want to keep at this writing thing this time around and see where it goes.

	<br />
* <strong>The Fire, as it Eats Itself</strong>, <em>forthcoming, 2021</em>: Helios Quarterly Magazine<br />
	This is one of my best stories, a good 15 years old since the first draft and generally unchanged since. Olivia Raymond and the fine folks at Helios will
	be bringing this your way very soon.
	

	
TDotSpec's One-Day Writing Challenge

Now entering it's third year, the Toronto Science Fiction and Fantasy Writing group -- possibly the largest speculative writing group in Canada -- puts on a one-day challenge
to write story in a consecutive 24-hour period. The stories are then compiled into an anthology that is sold online, warts and all. Which, considering you know going in what
you submit can't possible be perfect, is part of the challenge.

I'm heavily involved in this group, and recuse myself from entering its other various paid anthologies for which I often serve as a first reader or editor, but I've because
these anthologies are purely based on if you can complete the story and quality is to some extend secondary, I enter this every year. It's a lot of fun.

Therefore, I have a story in each of these volumes:

* <strong>In the Zone</strong>, <em>2018</em>: Sanctuary [Get it here on Amazon!](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07JC8T36D/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
* <strong>Eighteen Years</strong>, <em>2018</em>: Colony [Get it here on Amazon!](https://www.amazon.ca/Colony-one-shot-anthology-speculative-One-shot-ebook/dp/B07ZBKCR2S/ref=pd_rhf_se_p_img_6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=T8WAW8B3CH3X6X2CNNA4)
* <strong>The Common Sorcerer's Almanac</strong>, <em>2019</em>: Nourishment [Get it here on Amazon!](https://www.amazon.ca/Nourishment-One-Shot-Anthology-Speculative-speculative-ebook/dp/B07YF1P4GW/ref=pd_rhf_dp_p_img_4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=1QJ9B8ZBV9N28XKA7SEX)

	
I'll be updating this page as more stories are sold, so stay tuned!
