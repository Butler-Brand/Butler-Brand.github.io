Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

* A Few Days North of Vienna, 2003
	The story that started it all, more or less. This was perhaps the most mind-blowing experience of my life and I still
	have to convince myself that it happened. A great thrill to have my name alongside luminaries like Ken Liu, Jay Lake, Myke Cole, and
	who can forget my unforgettable WOTF roomie, Steve Saville [Copy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hubbard-Presents-Writers-Future-Vol/dp/1592121659)
* Secrets from the Land Without Fear, 2019
	My first story to be published after essentially giving it all up to concenrate on programming in late 2005. Part of Third Flatiron publishing's
	great anthology series. This one is in Book 26: Infinite Lives: Short Tales of Longevity [Get it here on Amazon!](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Lives-Longevity-Flatiron-Anthologies-ebook/dp/B07XVN23X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)
* AstroNosferatu and the Invisible Void
* All Aboard!
