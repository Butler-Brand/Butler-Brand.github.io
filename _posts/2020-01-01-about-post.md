## Who is this Brandon Butler?

Nobody, really.

Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Lived there 28 years before packing up and moving a couple places, then back, then out here to Toronto Ontario, where I'm at now.

I'm a computer programmer, like that's anything of a surprise these days. Been up to that professionally since 2005.

But where I'm really at is with the writing.
