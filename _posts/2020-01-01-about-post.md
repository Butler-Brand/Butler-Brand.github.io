## Who is this Brandon Butler?

Just some guy.

Oh, specifically? A Canadian, born and raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Lived there 28 years before packing up and moving a couple places, then back, then out here to Toronto Ontario, where I'm at now.

I'm a computer programmer; been up to that professionally since 2005, got the degreee and everything. Told myself it was my consolation prize for not getting a career in writing --
I thought about becomeing a journalist until I realized it wasn't for me.

But where I'm really at is writing. Science Fiction, Fantasy, and sometimes Horror, to be exact. I primarily write short stories, but I've been known to try my hand at a screenplay or two. Maybe one day I'll try
a novel, but for me that's really a large time to dedicate to just one story.
