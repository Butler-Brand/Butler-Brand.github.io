## Submissions for the Science Fiction Tarot


<p>Our submission process for this anthology will be a little different.</p>
<p><em>The Science Fiction Tarot</em> will contain 22 stories, one tale standing in for each of the cards of the major arcana and placing the anthologies word count at approximately 90-110K words. Stories of up to 7,500 words will be considered, but please be advised that submissions of 5,000 words and under will have the best chance to be selected.</p>
<p>Each author will be expected to submit a 1-3 word science fiction concept for a card, along with a story that exhibits that idea through character, plot or theme. <strong>Please have a clear archetype, setting, or SF subgenre and center your submission around the concept:</strong> the focus of the tale ought to be the idea conveyed, not tarot cards themselves.</p>
<p>For example, take the following images. They are followed by possible sample submission details (our form will ask for a few more things, naturally):<p>

	<div class="tile">
		<img src="/images/Tarot_AI.jpg" class="tarot_card" /><br />
		<strong>Tarot Concept:</strong> A.I<br />
		<strong>Story Title:</strong> Mechanized Justice<br />
		<strong>Number of words:</strong> 3,500<br />
	</div>

	<div class="tile">
		<img src="/images/Tarot_Geneticist.jpg" class="tarot_card" /><br />
		<strong>Tarot Concept:</strong> The Geneticist <br />
		<strong>Story Title:</strong> The Vats of Dr. Qualim <br />
		<strong>Number of words:</strong> 5,000  <br />
	</div>

<p>Other concepts might be a general location, such as a colony, or even a subgenre, such as post-apocalypse; anything that might be distilled down into a tarot card. Wow us with your ideas!</p>
<p>Upon acceptance, our plan is to commission an artist to work on a black & white illustration of the author's card concept to accompany their published story.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>

- Original stories will be accepted at our target rate of acceptance (1 cent/word minimum, stretch goal of 3 cents/word).
  <br /><br />
- Reprints will be accepted at a rate of 1 cent/word.
  <br /><br />
- No multiple submissions are allowed. Once your story has been rejected and, granted the submissions window is still open, you may submit again. If a story of yours has been accepted prior to the window closing, no further stories will be considered. One story at a time, please!
  <br /><br />
- Simultaneous submissions are allowed, provided we are promptly informed of the story's acceptance elsewhere


<p>We shall seek 3 months worldwide print and digital rights on original works selected. For reprints we will seek non-exclusive rights</p>
